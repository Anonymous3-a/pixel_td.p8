Juice:
- enemies bob up and down
- animate selection movement
- animation when trying to move selection fails
- bottom hud animates up/down
- screen shake on enemy reaching end
- spinning coin
- hitting right in the purchase menu nudges the arrow right and slides the next tower in

Notes:
- x to send wave (if you're selecting a tower, it'll sell the tower, but you can
    just rebuy it without losing money)
