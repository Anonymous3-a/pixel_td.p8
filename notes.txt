Juice:
- rubber banding when can't move selection
- screen shake on enemy reaching end
- cloud of puff/sparkles when buying/upgrading tower
- tracer on green laser
- enemy death?
- gold amount winds down after buying something?
- when hovering over the buy button, show the tower in the map with its range visible

Ideas:
- shoot 2/3 at a time for upgraded red tower
