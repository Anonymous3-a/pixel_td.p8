Juice:
- screen shake on enemy reaching end
- green laser fades out + in after switching targets
- gold amount winds down after buying something?
- when hovering over the buy button, show the tower in the map with its range visible
- sheen on path?

Ideas:
- shoot 2/3 at a time for upgraded red tower
