Juice:
- enemies bob up and down?
- rubber banding when can't move selection
- bottom menu animates up/down
- screen shake on enemy reaching end
- hitting right in the purchase menu nudges the arrow right and slides the next tower in
- cloud of puff/sparkles when buying/upgrading tower
- tracer on green laser
- enemy death?

Ideas:
- custom key repeat
- shoot 2/3 at a time for upgraded red tower
- hitting X to send next wave while selecting a tower: do you send wave or sell tower?
    - solution: you can't upgrade/sell a tower until you select it with Z.
